# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Machine Learning Project
Final portfolio project for the Codecademy Machine Learning Course

## Overview
This repository contains the code for a machine learning project aimed at developing a predictive model for breast cancer diagnosis using the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model development, evaluation, and deployment.

## Project Structure
- **Data:** The dataset used in this project (`wdbc.data`) can be found in the `Data` directory.
- **Code:** The main code for the project is provided in the Jupyter Notebook file named `breast_cancer_diagnosis_ml_project.ipynb`.
- **Models:** The trained machine learning models are saved in the `Models` directory in joblib format.
- **README:** This README file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and the files included in the repository.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, joblib

## Usage
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook `breast_cancer_diagnosis_ml_project.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code cells and analyze the results.

## Conclusion
The project aims to demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques for breast cancer diagnosis using real-world data. By exploring various algorithms, preprocessing techniques, and evaluation metrics, I have tried to increase the accuracy as much as possible.

I strive to build an accurate predictive model that can assist medical professionals in early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer.
